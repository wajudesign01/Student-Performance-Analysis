Encouraging students to create a structured study plan and studying in groups , can help them utilize and maximize the hours spent on study.

- Parental support plays a crucial role in a student academic performance, as shown on my dashboard students who receives below average
parental supports exhibits weak performance in academics. 
Schools can provide workshops to educate parents on how they can effectively support their children’s education, they can also establish
regular communication with parents through meetings, or online platforms to keep them informed about their child’s progress.

- Performance based on students participation in extracurricular activities; To optimize the impact of extracurricular activities,
  schools can integrate academics with extracurriculars to reinforce learning while participating in extracurriculars

- It is boldly indicated that students with high numbers of school attendance have great academic performance compared to others.
 Providing early supports through counselling to students with poor attendance can be of the solutions to help improve.
